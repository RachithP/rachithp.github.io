Hola!, Mucho gusto!
Well, I'm not a spanish person as you can see from my name,but I certainly love learing spanish!

I'm a graduate student pursuing Masters in Robotics at the University of Maryland, College Park. My interests currently are in the field of controls, Vision and Perception aspects of Robotics.

I'm originally from MYSURU (Namma Mysuru!!), studied uptil 12th in Mysuru and then did my undergraduation in ECE from NITK. I did my major project under guidance of Dr. Deepu Vijayasenan and with the help from SOLVE lab on Brain Computer Interface. 

In my spare time, I play soccer, read novels, cook!!.
