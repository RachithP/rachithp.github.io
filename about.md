I hail from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysore">Mysuru, India</a>. Prior to joining UMD, I did my Bachelors in Electronics and Communications Engineering at  <a href="https://www.nitk.ac.in/">National Institute of Technology Karntaka Surathkal</a>. At NITK, I worked on developing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=687DesAL3YE">Brain Computer Interface Applications</a> as my final project and was advised by <a href="http://www.ece.nitk.ac.in/faculty/deepu-vijayasenan">Dr. Deepu Vijayasenan</a>.
