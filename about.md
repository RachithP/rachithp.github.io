<h3>About me</h3>
<p class="col">
I'm a research engineer at Intel. My interests and experiences are shaped around building software solutions across the intersection of Computer Vision, Robotics and Embodied-AI domains. I primarily develop software frameworks, and functionalities to support research in Embodied AI, Computer Vision domains. I'm currently working on <a href="https://github.com/spear-sim/spear">SPEAR - A Simulator for Photorealistic Embodied AI Research </a>. I obtained my <a href="https://robotics.umd.edu/">Masters in Robotics </a> from the University of Maryland, College Park in 2020. During my Masters, I explored Bayesian Deep Learning with primary focus on Reinforcement Learning. I obtained my Bachelors in Electronics and Communications Engineering from the <a href="https://www.nitk.ac.in/">National Institute of Technology Karntaka Surathkal (NITK)</a> in 2016. At NITK, I worked on developing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=687DesAL3YE">Brain Computer Interface Applications</a> as my final project and was advised by <a href="http://www.ece.nitk.ac.in/faculty/deepu-vijayasenan">Dr. Deepu Vijayasenan</a>.
